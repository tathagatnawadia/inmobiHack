what's wrong with people..I don't think truffles deserves such ratings... yes it's a fairly decent place with good enough food to make you happy but such high ratings perhaps are misleading... I think vegetarians will struggle a bit.. although there is a lot to offer on the menu even to the veggies but the food itself was just too cheesy and chewy...my burger was pretty good but we ordered over 15 times from the menu and apart from a couple of burgers everything else was average. This isn't the first time I have visited truffles so it is not a one time average experience... the two good things in my opinion are.. value for money and secondly the staff, which is very efficient.. I don't think I would like to wait for 30 mins to get a place and then get average food
